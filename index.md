## Vision

It is an exciting time to be working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Music and Audio. In the same way Computer Vision was forever changed in 2012 by the successful (re)introduction of CNN's, I think audio will forever be changed by WaveNet and NSynth. By sharing my passion from Physics, Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning to Music and Industrial Design with the Brain research team, I hope to:

- Push the envelope of Deep Learning in audio applications, such as developing a WaveNet GAN that feeds the rendered waveform into a realtime wavetable synthesier.
- Diversify applications of AI to cultures and languages typically not found in neural models, such as those from my home region of Thailand and Southeast Asia. 
- Cross polinate machine learning with industrial and traditional design processes (e.g CNC milling, 3D printing as well as woodworking, pottery), for an example an RL agent that designs a musical instrument alongside a carpenter by using Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to simulate and iterate on the instrument's tone, or target frequency response, before physical fabrication. 

The following links are curated in the order they were presented in my Cover Letter. 

## Extending Magenta's NSynth

The winning hack from the team I led was recently featured on the [Google Magenta Blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/2017/09/12/outside-hacks/). We documented how we connected the open sourced NSynth model to a real-time data streaming system that enabled a group of phones to control where on the latent space Z in the autoencoder the waveform was being generated from.

## Patent-pending Surrogate Soundboard System

My BS Thesis in Applied Physics develops a mechanism for transferring acoustic vibrations from a live violin to a remote violin using custom-fabricated transducers and digital inverse filters. A version of my thesis appears as a paper in [ICMC 2017](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ywxxt5kxx49h3z/ICMC%20Surrogate%20L.%20Hantrakul%202016.pdf?dl=0).

## Fidular

_Fidular_ is a patent-pending and award-winning cross-cultural modular fiddle system, placing in the top 5% of designs at [A' Design Awards](https://competition.adesignaward.com/design.php?ID=50765) and winning Student Runner Up to the [Core 77 Design Awards](http://designawards.core77.com/Open-Design/64638/Fidular-Modular-Fiddle-System). It enables musicians and luthiers to detach and interchange components such as strings and chambers between fiddles from across the Asia and the Middle East. A print of this design is currently in special exhibition at the [Musical Instruments Museum](https://mim.org/) in Phoenix, AZ and accepted to [NIME 2017 conference](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3mfkh3yc6ul5qlm/L%20Hantrakul%20NIME16%20Fidular%20UPLOAD.pdf?dl=0)
